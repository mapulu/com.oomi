# Oomi

# The LED bulb does not work with this app. The probable reason is a faulty firmware. The Bulb is recognized as a battery device. Therefore Homey does not send commands to the Bulb. I tried workarrounds which unfortunately don't work. I have contacted Athom and Oomi about this problem, there is no solution yet.


This app adds support for Oomi devices in Homey.

More devices will be added later. Please send me a message if you want a specific device to be added.
